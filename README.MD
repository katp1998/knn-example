This project will demonstrate:
- How KNN can be done to recommend movies (based on genre)
- EDA to show insights about the data

To perform KNN predictions, following libraries are mainly used:
- SciPy
- TensorTlow

EDA + converesions are done through:
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

Instructions:
- Install pip
- Ensure you have python version 3.11
- run: ```pip install pandas numpy json tensorflow matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scipy```
